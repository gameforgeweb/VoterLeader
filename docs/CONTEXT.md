Project Name: VoterLeader – Political Statistics Dashboard

Overview:
This project is a clean, modern, and minimal political statistics website based on a Figma design layout. The goal is to visualize city-level election and voter insights through an elegant, responsive interface. All elements should follow the visual structure and layout shown in the provided image.

Typography:
- Primary Font: Barlow (use Google Fonts or local import)

Design Goals:
- Minimal, modern, and elegant UI
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Soft shadows, neutral color palette, and consistent padding/margins
- Clean grid-based alignment
- Use placeholder data for now
- Include all visual elements from the layout exactly as shown

Page 1 – Statistics Overview Page (Main Landing Page)
- Top Navigation:
  - Left-aligned logo text: **VOTERLEADER**
  - Right-aligned buttons: **SIGN UP** and **LOGIN** (minimal style)
  - City Selector Button: Default = **Andhra Pradesh**, dropdown for other cities

- Main Stats Section:
  - Two large side-by-side cards:
    - **VOTER BOX**: Contains placeholder text like "Total Population: 1.2M", "Male: 52%", "Female: 48%", "Literacy: 71%"
    - **LEADER BOX**: Contains placeholder text like "Name: Rakesh Yadav", "Party: Progressive Front", "Runner-Up: Deepa Singh", "Votes: 98,121"

- Charts Section:
  - Three labeled pie charts below the boxes:
    1. **GENDER** – e.g., Male vs Female %
    2. **LITERACY** – e.g., Literate vs Non-literate
    3. **VOTE SHARE** – e.g., Party A: 60%, Party B: 40%
  - Each pie chart has a **legend box below** it

Additional Instructions:
- Wait for instructions on future pages.
- Use clean React components and Tailwind (or equivalent utility-first CSS).
- All components should be modular and reusable.
- Do not hardcode styles, use variables or class utilities wherever possible.
